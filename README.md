# My First Ever Spigot Plugin

Last year (2023), I was always playing on the vivsmp server (`vivsmp.net`) in Minecraft. I discovered it from watching the content creator "Vivilly" on YouTube. It was the first SMP I ever played and I found it so cool because of the many custom commands, rich set of features, and more! I played there for almost quarter a year

On January 13, 2024, I met a player named `Nate`. He was very nice and he is a new developer on the server. While he was online on the server that day, I asked him how he became a developer. He replied that he had asked `0null`, another developer on the server. Then I asked how I could become a developer too. He asked if I knew Java, and I said yes (I knew Java at that time but I wasnt very experienced yet haha). He told me to ask `0null` to take a test to assess my skills

We contacted each other on Discord, and `0null` assigned me a test. The test required me to despawn all the nearby wither skeletons if the server was slowing down (I forgot the exact details). I installed Maven, set up the necessary files, included dependencies, and started coding. At that time I didnt know the Spigot API well, so I relied heavily on the documentation. After coding, it compiled successfully, and I sent the jar file and the source code to them on Discord

They said they would test it live on a call and asked if I could join a voice chat. I said I couldnt because I am very privacy-conscious and `0null` and `Nate` were still new to me. They told me they would have to turn me down if I didnt join the call, and they apologized because it was required. So, I joined the call with my mic and camera off. Unfortunately I neither passed nor failed. They just didnt come to a conclusion. `0null` said they needed me to speak on the mic to make a final decision

I learned a lot from this test. It was my first job-interview-like experience! This repository contains a test Spigot plugin assigned to me. If you can review it, I would appreciate it! Please provide your feedback in an issue thread. Thanks for reading!
